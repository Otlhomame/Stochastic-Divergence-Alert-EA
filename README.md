# Technical Entry Alert Tool

It is well known that part of the gate keeping process to capital deployment in a macroeconomic portfolio involves techincal analysis. 
This is a simple tool to detect stochastic divergence on the same instance as a break of structure (reversal) in a buyer's and seller's market. It was designed for an ideal Islamic funding trading account.
Ideally, an agressive approach would involve scaling in via lower time frames (using the same method) in the same direction. An engulfing technical signal merely represents a break of structure and this boilerplate setup could be adapted to time compressions if the divergent condition is still valid.

Examples below are run on recent market conditions using standard issue MQL4 Stochastic parameters of %K Period: 5 & %D Period: 3

# Sell Signal

Notice a liquidity grab before structure was broken as an engulfing candle with Stochastic divergence at play.

# Buy Signal

The same happened for a buy setup

Ideally, this method should help spot areas with the least drawdown entry opportunities.
